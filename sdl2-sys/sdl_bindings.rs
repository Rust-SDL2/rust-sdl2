As such,\n this function will never return a 1 so as not to conflict with the legacy\n function.\n\n Please note that SDL 2.0 before 2.0.5 did not support recording; as such,\n this function would fail if `iscapture` was not zero. Starting with SDL\n 2.0.5, recording is implemented and this value can be non-zero.\n\n Passing in a `device` name of NULL requests the most reasonable default\n (and is equivalent to what SDL_OpenAudio() does to choose a device). The\n `device` name is a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName(), but\n some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a\n hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the\n diskaudio driver.\n\n An opened audio device starts out paused, and should be enabled for playing\n by calling SDL_PauseAudioDevice(devid, 0) when you are ready for your audio\n callback function to be called. Since the audio driver may modify the\n requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate any local mixing\n buffers after you open the audio device.\n\n The audio callback runs in a separate thread in most cases; you can prevent\n race conditions between your callback and other threads without fully\n pausing playback with SDL_LockAudioDevice(). For more information about the\n callback, see SDL_AudioSpec.\n\n Managing the audio spec via 'desired' and 'obtained':\n\n When filling in the desired audio spec structure:\n\n - `desired->freq` should be the frequency in sample-frames-per-second (Hz).\n - `desired->format` should be the audio format (`AUDIO_S16SYS`, etc).\n - `desired->samples` is the desired size of the audio buffer, in _sample\n   frames_ (with stereo output, two samples--left and right--would make a\n   single sample frame). This number should be a power of two, and may be\n   adjusted by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.\n   Good values seem to range between 512 and 4096 inclusive, depending on\n   the application and CPU speed. Smaller values reduce latency, but can\n   lead to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot\n   fill the audio buffer in time. Note that the number of sample frames is\n   directly related to time by the following formula: `ms =\n   (sampleframes*1000)/freq`\n - `desired->size` is the size in _bytes_ of the audio buffer, and is\n   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.\n - `desired->silence` is the value used to set the buffer to silence, and is\n   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.\n - `desired->callback` should be set to a function that will be called when\n   the audio device is ready for more data. It is passed a pointer to the\n   audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer. This function\n   usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should protect data\n   structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudioDevice() and\n   SDL_UnlockAudioDevice() in your code. Alternately, you may pass a NULL\n   pointer here, and call SDL_QueueAudio() with some frequency, to queue\n   more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call\n   SDL_DequeueAudio() with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).\n - `desired->userdata` is passed as the first parameter to your callback\n   function. If you passed a NULL callback, this value is ignored.\n\n `allowed_changes` can have the following flags OR'd together:\n\n - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE`\n - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE`\n - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE`\n - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_SAMPLES_CHANGE`\n - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE`\n\n These flags specify how SDL should behave when a device cannot offer a\n specific feature. If the application requests a feature that the hardware\n doesn't offer, SDL will always try to get the closest equivalent.\n\n For example, if you ask for float32 audio format, but the sound card only\n supports int16, SDL will set the hardware to int16. If you had set\n SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE, SDL will change the format in the `obtained`\n structure. If that flag was *not* set, SDL will prepare to convert your\n callback's float32 audio to int16 before feeding it to the hardware and\n will keep the originally requested format in the `obtained` structure.\n\n The resulting audio specs, varying depending on hardware and on what\n changes were allowed, will then be written back to `obtained`.\n\n If your application can only handle one specific data format, pass a zero\n for `allowed_changes` and let SDL transparently handle any differences.\n\n \\param device a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName() or a\n               driver-specific name as appropriate.

First, the\n components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their\n blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and\n calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.\n\n Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:\n\n ```c\n dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);\n dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);\n ```\n\n Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,\n dst)` can return one of the following:\n\n - `src + dst`\n - `src - dst`\n - `dst - src`\n - `min(src, dst)`\n - `max(src, dst)`\n\n The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,\n second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively.

They will\n return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.\n\n This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer in\n SDL 2.0.6.

May support color and alpha\n   operations being different from each other. May support color and alpha\n   factors being different from each other.\n - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,\n   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`\n   operations with all factors.\n - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.\n - **software**: No custom blend mode support.\n\n Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render\n target.

If you code carefully, you can handle\n these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:\n\n - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;\n   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current\n   before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or\n   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function\n   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a\n   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer\n   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to\n   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy\n   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.\n - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any\n   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.\n   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you\n   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that\n   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually\n   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the\n   existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),\n   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function\n   as core functionality.\n - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function\n   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for\n   extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that\n   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you\n   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.\n - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.\n   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not\n   make the same promises about function pointers.\n - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example\n   code.

North is considered to be away from the user.\n\n The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:\n\n ```\n                .--.\n                |__| .-------.\n                |=.| |.-----.|\n                |--| ||     ||\n                |  | |'-----'|\n                |__|~')_____('\n                  [ COMPUTER ]\n\n\n                    North (0,-1)\n                        ^\n                        |\n                        |\n  (-1,0)  West <----[ HAPTIC ]----> East (1,0)\n                        |\n                        |\n                        v\n                     South (0,1)\n\n\n                     [ USER ]\n                       \\|||/\n                       (o o)\n                 ---ooO-(_)-Ooo---\n ```\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a degree\n starting north and turning clockwise. SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses the first\n `dir` parameter. The cardinal directions would be:\n\n - North: 0 (0 degrees)\n - East: 9000 (90 degrees)\n - South: 18000 (180 degrees)\n - West: 27000 (270 degrees)\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions (X\n axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)). SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses the first\n three `dir` parameters. The cardinal directions would be:\n\n - North: 0,-1, 0\n - East: 1, 0, 0\n - South: 0, 1, 0\n - West: -1, 0, 0\n\n The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise it's\n unused. In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you can\n use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations. The\n first two `dir` parameters are used. The `dir` parameters are as follows\n (all values are in hundredths of degrees):\n\n - Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1).\n - Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes).\n\n Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming\n from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):\n\n ```c\n  SDL_HapticDirection direction;\n\n  // Cartesian directions\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding.\n  direction.dir[0] = 0; // X position\n  direction.dir[1] = 1; // Y position\n  // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter.\n\n  // Polar directions\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding.\n  direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter\n\n  // Spherical coordinates\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding\n  direction.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters.\n ```\n\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_STEERING_AXIS\n \\sa SDL_HapticEffect\n \\sa SDL_HapticNumAxes"]
